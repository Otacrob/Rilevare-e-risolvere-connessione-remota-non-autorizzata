# üõ°Ô∏è Snort 3 IDS Lab ‚Äì Detecting Unauthorized Remote Access

This project documents the full installation and configuration of **Snort++ (3.7.2.0)** on **Kali Linux**, compiled from source and enhanced with `snort3_extra`.

This lab attempts to simulates a realistic environment for traffic monitoring and alerting.

## üéØ Objectives

- Compile and install Snort 3 from source
- Enable packet capture support
- Install `snort3_extra` modules for advanced inspection
- Simulate remote access attempts between VMs
- Build a detection-ready IDS

## üì∏ Installation Steps (Visual Walkthrough)

### 1. Virtual Machine Setup  
Creating two virtual environments based on Kali Linux (one for IDS and analysis purposes and the other to create network traffic attempting to connect to the first machine) and launching the defending machine.

---

### 2. System Update  
Updating Kali Linux to ensure compatibility and stability before building Snort and its dependencies.

![System Update](images/2-kali-update.png)

---

### 3. Installing Dependencies  
Installing all necessary development tools and libraries (compilers, network capture libs, LuaJIT, etc.) required for compiling Snort and DAQ from source.

![Install Dependencies](images/3-Install-dependencies.png)

---

### 4. Downloading Snort, DAQ and Extras  
Downloading and extracting the Snort 3, DAQ 3.0.19 and snort3_extra source files.

![Download Snort](images/4-Download-Snort.png)

---

### 5. Compiling and Installing DAQ  
Compiling and installing **libdaq version 3.0.19** from source. This step enables Snort to interface with different packet acquisition methods (like `pcap`, `afpacket`, `nfq`, etc.), which are essential for capturing and inspecting live network traffic.

![Install DAQ](images/5-Install-daq.png)

---

### 6. Configuring Snort with CMake  
Preparing the Snort 3 build environment using its custom configuration script to generate the required CMake structure and enable optional features such as tcmalloc ‚Äî a high-performance memory allocator that reduces memory fragmentation and improves allocation speed, especially in multi-threaded environments. This optimization is particularly beneficial for Snort, which processes high volumes of packets and performs intensive rule-matching operations in real time.

---

### 7. Building Snort  
Compiling the Snort engine source code into executable binaries using the generated CMake files.

![Building Snort](images/7-Building-Snort.png)

---

### 8. Installing Snort  
Installing the compiled Snort binaries and libraries into the system path (/usr/local) and updating the dynamic linker cache.

![Installing Snort](images/8-Installing-Snort.png)

---

### 9. Post-install Configuration  
Running `ldconfig` to refresh shared library links after installing Snort. This ensures all dependencies (like DAQ modules) are correctly linked when Snort is executed.

---

### 10. Compiling snort3_extra  
Building the snort3_extra modules which include additional protocol parsers and enhancements to extend Snort‚Äôs detection capabilities.

![Compiling Extra](images/10-Compiling-Snort-extra.png)

---

### 11. Installing snort3_extra  
Installing the compiled snort3_extra modules into the system to be available for use by Snort during runtime.

![Installing Extra](images/11-Installing-snort-extra.png)

---

### 12. Testing Snort  
Running Snort with the validated Lua configuration to ensure that the engine initializes correctly and the DAQ modules are loaded successfully.

## ‚úÖ Final Outcome

- ‚úÖ Snort 3 built and installed successfully
- ‚úÖ DAQ with `pcap` module fully working
- ‚úÖ snort3_extra modules installed and ready
- ‚úÖ Lab environment prepared for live testing and rule development

üîê Custom SSH Rule Setup and Testing with Snort 3
This section documents the creation of a custom Snort 3 rule to detect SSH connection attempts, including configuration and validation steps with illustrative screenshots.

1. Checking the Rules File Existence
We verify the presence of Snort configuration files under /usr/local/etc/snort.

![Checking the Rules File Existence](./ssh/1.checking-rules-file-existence.png)

2. Creating the Rules File
We create the rules directory and the custom.rules file for our custom SSH detection logic.

![Creating the Rules File](./ssh/2.Creating-the-rules-file.png)

3. Opening the Rules File with Nano
We edit the custom.rules file using nano.

![Opening the Rules File with Nano](./ssh/3.Opening-it-with-nano.png)

4. Writing the SSH Detection Rule
We insert a rule that alerts on any TCP connection targeting port 22.

alert tcp any any -> any 22 (msg:"[SSH DETECTED] SSH connection attempt detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
![Writing the SSH Detection Rule](./ssh/4.Writing-detection-rule.png)

5. Opening the Snort Configuration File
We open snort.lua to link our new rule file.

![Opening the Snort Configuration File](./ssh/5.Opening-lua-file.png)

6. Modifying the IPS Section
We edit the ips block in the .lua config to load our custom rule.

![Modifying the IPS Section](./ssh/6.Lua-ips-section.png)

7. Testing the Lua Configuration
We validate the configuration with Snort‚Äôs test mode.

![Testing the Lua Configuration](./ssh/7.Testing-the-lua-file.png)

8. Identifying the Interface for Snort
We identify the correct interface (eth1) where Snort should listen.

![Identifying the Interface for Snort](./ssh/8.Getting-the-defending-ip-address.png)

9. Starting Snort in IDS Mode
We launch Snort using the .lua configuration on the selected interface.

![Starting Snort in IDS Mode](./ssh/9.Starting-snort-on-IDS-mode.png)

10. Initiating SSH Connection for Detection
An SSH connection attempt is initiated from the attacker machine to test the rule.
