# üõ°Ô∏è Snort 3 IDS Lab ‚Äì Detecting Unauthorized Remote Access

This project documents the full installation and configuration of **Snort++ (3.7.2.0)** on **Kali Linux**, compiled from source and enhanced with `DAQ` and `snort3_extra`.

This lab is based on the **TryHackMe SOC1** path and simulates a realistic environment for traffic monitoring and alerting.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Compile and install Snort 3 from source
- Enable packet capture support (DAQ + PCAP)
- Install `snort3_extra` modules for advanced inspection
- Simulate remote access attempts between VMs
- Build a detection-ready IDS

## ‚úÖ Final Outcome

- ‚úÖ Snort 3 built and installed successfully
- ‚úÖ DAQ with `pcap` module fully working
- ‚úÖ snort3_extra modules installed and ready
- ‚úÖ Lab environment prepared for live testing and rule development

---

## üìÇ Next Steps

- ‚úçÔ∏è Write detection rules (e.g., SSH brute-force)
- üß™ Simulate traffic between attacker and target VM
- üìä Capture alerts and logs for analysis (PCAP / fast alert)
- üìÅ Organize your project with `/rules`, `/pcap`, `/log` folders
