# 🛡️ Snort 3 IDS Lab – Detecting Unauthorized Remote Access

This project documents the full installation and configuration of **Snort++ (3.7.2.0)** on **Kali Linux**, compiled from source and enhanced with `snort3_extra`.

This lab attempts to simulates a realistic environment for traffic monitoring and alerting.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Compile and install Snort 3 from source
- Enable packet capture support
- Install `snort3_extra` modules for advanced inspection
- Simulate remote access attempts between VMs
- Build a detection-ready IDS

## ✅ Final Outcome

- ✅ Snort 3 built and installed successfully
- ✅ DAQ with `pcap` module fully working
- ✅ snort3_extra modules installed and ready
- ✅ Lab environment prepared for live testing and rule development

---

## 📂 Next Steps

- ✍️ Write detection rules (e.g., SSH brute-force)
- 🧪 Simulate traffic between attacker and target VM
- 📊 Capture alerts and logs for analysis (PCAP / fast alert)
- 📁 Organize your project with `/rules`, `/pcap`, `/log` folders
